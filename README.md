# Philippine Consumer Equity Index Fund - 2024 Risk Vs. Return

# Problem Statement
The Philippine Consumer Equity Index Fund is experiencing persistent underperformance, with negative returns across multiple time periods, including a –0.06% 1‑year return, –0.03% 6‑month return, and a deeper –0.16% 3‑year decline. It also exhibits high volatility (0.12%) and a significant maximum drawdown of –0.45%, indicating substantial downside risk.

Overall, the fund shows high risk without adequate return, suggesting structural issues in sector exposure, index construction, or market participation—resulting in a weak competitive position compared to other funds.

# Data
The data being used is a Historical NAV file of 33 BPI funds extracted from Kaggle. The file covered the Date, Fund Code, Fund Name, Net Asset Value, and Currency.

# Methodology

I used excel to clean the file by fixing the headers, spaces, capitalization, and columns. With the help CoPilot AI, I was able to extract the funds that are underperforming and top performing. In this way, we can easily digest the data and sort the problem.

I pull out one of the underperforming fund in the file and prompt the problem from CoPilot.

I made a Power BI dashboard to simplify the 2024 performance of Philippine Consumer Equity Index Fund and highlighted the Risk and Return.
