# Insights

- Returns were negative in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023

Solution: Add stronger, more resilient companies so the fund can grow more reliably instead of ending most years below where it started.
(Data: All four years posted negative returns.)

- Max Drawdown showed big drops—especially in 2020 and again in 2021–2023

Solution: Reduce exposure to the most sensitive consumer areas (like entertainment and cyclic retail) and increase exposure to essential goods (like food and household products) to soften future drops.
(Data: Worst declines reached deep levels in multiple years.)

- Annual Volatility was high across most years (showing an unstable ride)
   
Solution: Add steadier companies, avoid heavy concentration in jumpy names, and rebalance toward more predictable subsectors to smooth out the fund’s ups and downs.
(Data: Volatility stayed elevated in 2020–2023 before slightly improving.)

# Recommendation

## Choose better companies to include in the fund 

Think of the fund like a basket of items. If some items keep going bad, the basket won’t look good.
The fund needs to replace weaker companies with stronger, more promising ones.

Choices you can consider:

“Competency level” is expressed as a simple percentage return.

## What Is a Fund?
A fund is basically a big money pool.
People put their money together in one large pot, and a professional (called a fund manager) uses that money to buy things like stocks, bonds, or other investments.

Think of it like a Group Shopping Basket

Imagine you and your friends want to buy something expensive — like a big basket of groceries.
Instead of each person buying things alone, everyone chips in:

- You put in a little
- Others put in a little
- Together, you can buy more and better variety

That’s what a fund does:
It lets many people invest together instead of investing alone.

Now what is an EQUITY INDEX FUND?

Equity = Means owning a piece of a company.

Index = A list of companies.

Equity Index Fund = A fund that copies that list.

Now put it all together:

An Equity Index Fund is a shared money pool that buys tiny pieces of all the companies in a specific list (index).

- It does not try to guess which companies will do well.
- It simply follows the list — like following a recipe exactly.
