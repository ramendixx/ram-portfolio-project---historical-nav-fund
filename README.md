# Problem Statement

It also experiences a lot of ups and downs, making it feel unstable and unpredictable. This means that people who invest in it may feel like they’re riding a bumpy road—never quite sure if things will improve. It needs careful review and improvements so it can finally get back on track.

The problem and question to be answered in this portfolio is how do we do that? In this fund overview, we will simplify the analysis of the fund performance based on its 2020-2024 data and how it will recovery from its challenges moving forward.

With the help CoPilot AI, I was able to extract the funds that are under performing. In this way, we can easily digest the data, pick one fund, and create the problem.

I made a Power BI dashboard to simplify the 2020-2024 performance of Philippine Consumer Equity Index Fund. Using the CoPilot I was able to prompt what is the Return, Max Drawdown, and Annual Volatility. (Overwhelmed with the finance jargon? No worries! A dictionay is available on the last page.)

For further context of the fund's challenges, here is the simple performance timeline.

# 2020 – A tough and unstable year
The fund had a rough time because many consumer businesses struggled during the pandemic.
Think of it like a store that suddenly lost many customers — the fund didn’t grow, and its value went up and down a lot.

# 2021 – The recovery was slow
Even though things were starting to reopen, the fund didn’t bounce back as strongly as expected.
It was like trying to stand up after falling but still feeling unsteady.

# 2022 – Still facing challenges
Consumer companies were affected by rising costs, inflation, and supply issues.
The fund continued to move unevenly, like riding a bike on a road with many bumps.

# 2023 – Some stability, but still weak
The fund became a bit steadier compared to previous years, but it still didn’t keep up with others in the same category.
Imagine a plant that stopped getting worse, but also didn’t really grow.

# 2024 (early part of the year)
The fund finally showed a small sign of improvement in the first days of 2024, but it’s too early to say if this will last.
It’s like seeing sunshine after days of rain—you hope it continues, but you can’t be sure yet.


# Insights and Recommendations

## Choose better companies to include in the fund

Think of the fund like a basket of items. If some items keep going bad, the basket won’t look good.
The fund needs to replace weaker companies with stronger, more promising ones.

## Adjust the mix to make it less shaky
The fund has been too bumpy. Choosing companies that are more stable can help smooth out that ride.

## Keep the basket updated more often
The world changes fast. The fund needs regular check‑ups so it doesn’t get stuck holding companies that no longer fit today’s consumer trends.

## Focus on companies that match what consumers want today
Things people buy have changed a lot since 2020. The fund should shift toward businesses that are strong in the current environment (e.g., essentials, digital‑based consumer brands).

## Communicate a clearer direction to investors
Investors feel more confident when the fund has a clear plan. Sharing a simple “here’s how we’re improving” message helps rebuild trust.
