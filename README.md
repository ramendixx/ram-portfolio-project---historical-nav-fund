## What Is a Fund?
A fund is basically a big money pool.
People put their money together in one large pot, and a professional (called a fund manager) uses that money to buy things like stocks, bonds, or other investments.

Think of it like a Group Shopping Basket

Imagine you and your friends want to buy something expensive — like a big basket of groceries.
Instead of each person buying things alone, everyone chips in:

- You put in a little
- Others put in a little
- Together, you can buy more and better variety

That’s what a fund does:
It lets many people invest together instead of investing alone.

Now what is an EQUITY INDEX FUND?

Equity = Means owning a piece of a company.

Index = A list of companies.

Equity Index Fund = A fund that copies that list.

Now put it all together:

An Equity Index Fund is a shared money pool that buys tiny pieces of all the companies in a specific list (index).

- It does not try to guess which companies will do well.
- It simply follows the list — like following a recipe exactly.

# Methodology

I used excel to clean the file by fixing the headers, spaces, capitalization, and columns.

With the help CoPilot AI, I was able to extract the funds that are under performing. In this way, we can easily digest the data, pick one fund, and create the problem.

I made a Power BI dashboard to simplify the 2020-2024 performance of Philippine Consumer Equity Index Fund. Using the CoPilot I was able to prompt what is the Return, Max Drawdown, and Annual Volatility.
Return shows if the fund grows, Max Drawdown shows how bad things can get, and Volatility shows how stressful the ride is — together, they help you understand if the fund is strong or shaky.

# Why NAV matters
NAV tells an investor:

• How much it costs to buy one share

• How much your share is worth if you sell it

It’s just like checking the price tag of one item in a store.

For further context of the fund's challenges, here is the simple performance timeline.

## 2020 – A tough and unstable year
The fund had a rough time because many consumer businesses struggled during the pandemic.
Think of it like a store that suddenly lost many customers — the fund didn’t grow, and its value went up and down a lot.

## 2021 – The recovery was slow
Even though things were starting to reopen, the fund didn’t bounce back as strongly as expected.
It was like trying to stand up after falling but still feeling unsteady.

## 2022 – Still facing challenges
Consumer companies were affected by rising costs, inflation, and supply issues.
The fund continued to move unevenly, like riding a bike on a road with many bumps.

## 2023 – Some stability, but still weak
The fund became a bit steadier compared to previous years, but it still didn’t keep up with others in the same category.
Imagine a plant that stopped getting worse, but also didn’t really grow.

## 2024 (early part of the year)
The fund finally showed a small sign of improvement in the first days of 2024, but it’s too early to say if this will last.
It’s like seeing sunshine after days of rain—you hope it continues, but you can’t be sure yet.


# Insights and Recommendations

## Choose better companies to include in the fund

Think of the fund like a basket of items. If some items keep going bad, the basket won’t look good.
The fund needs to replace weaker companies with stronger, more promising ones.

Current companies:

## Adjust the mix to make it less shaky
The fund has been too bumpy. Choosing companies that are more stable can help smooth out that ride.

Choices you can consider:

## Keep the basket updated more often
The world changes fast. The fund needs regular check‑ups so it doesn’t get stuck holding companies that no longer fit today’s consumer trends.

Here are the visual POV of how much consumer are there really is per sector of this fund since 2020 and their subsector categories.

What we learned about these graphs?
These tells us that the consumers are spending more on Consumer Staples—the everyday needs.

## Focus on companies that match what consumers want today
Things people buy have changed a lot since 2020. And based on our graphs the strongest environment are the Consumer Staples. If the fund could shift toward these businesses environment, it may recuperate easily.
(e.g., essentials, digital‑based consumer brands).

## Communicate a clearer direction to investors
Investors feel more confident when the fund has a clear plan. Sharing a simple “here’s how we’re improving” message helps rebuild trust.
