The fund needs to replace weaker companies with stronger, more promising ones.

Current companies:

  ## What Is a Fund?
A fund is basically a big money pool.
People put their money together in one large pot, and a professional (called a fund manager) uses that money to buy things like stocks, bonds, or other investments.

Think of it like a Group Shopping Basket

Imagine you and your friends want to buy something expensive — like a big basket of groceries.
Instead of each person buying things alone, everyone chips in:

- You put in a little
- Others put in a little
- Together, you can buy more and better variety

That’s what a fund does:
It lets many people invest together instead of investing alone.

Now what is an EQUITY INDEX FUND?

Equity = Means owning a piece of a company.

Index = A list of companies.

Equity Index Fund = A fund that copies that list.

Now put it all together:

An Equity Index Fund is a shared money pool that buys tiny pieces of all the companies in a specific list (index).

- It does not try to guess which companies will do well.
- It simply follows the list — like following a recipe exactly.
